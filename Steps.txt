Create Django Project and Core App
    We start by creating the main Django project (kioko_enterprises) and a reusable app (core) that will house shared logic like templates, base views, and utility functions.
        kioko_enterprises/ contains project settings and URLs
        core/ will serve as the foundational app for shared components
Install Required Packages
    Install the core dependencies needed for this project:
        djangorestframework: for building RESTful APIs
        django-allauth: for email/password and Google login
        django-bootstrap5: for responsive UI components
        python-decouple: for managing environment variables securely
        psycopg2-binary: PostgreSQL adapter for Django
Configure Environment Variables
    Create a .env file to store sensitive configuration values like database credentials and secret keys. This keeps secrets out of version control and supports reproducibility across environments.
Update settings.py
    Modify Django settings to:
        Load environment variables using python-decouple
        Configure PostgreSQL as the database
        Register installed apps including DRF, Allauth, and Bootstrap
        Set up authentication backends for social login
Configure Static and Media Files
    Set up paths for static assets (CSS, JS) and media files (product images, user uploads). This ensures proper handling during development and deployment.
Create Base Template
    Create a reusable base HTML template using Bootstrap 5. This will serve as the layout foundation for all pages (homepage, product listings, cart, etc.).
